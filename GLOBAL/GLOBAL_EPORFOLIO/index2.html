    <h1>⭐ ASIR Second Year Challenge Portfolio 💻</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to my very basic portfolio for the second year of **ASIR**
        (Advanced vocational training in Networked IT Systems Administration).
        This page summarizes the work and challenges from the modules:
        <strong>SECURITY</strong>, <strong>BASES2</strong>, <strong>IAW</strong>, <strong>PYTHON</strong>, and <strong>GLOBAL</strong>.
        <br>
        I built this using *only* **HTML**. No fancy CSS or JavaScript here!

    <br>

    <h3>Challenge 1: Setting up a Firewall with iptables</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> I had to install and configure a basic firewall using **iptables** on a Linux server. The goal was to secure the server by allowing only SSH and HTTP traffic, dropping everything else. It was my first time with iptables.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The difference between **STATEFUL** and **STATELESS** firewalls. I learned about connection tracking.</li>
                <li>The **'Three-way handshake'** (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and how it's related to the `RELATED,ESTABLISHED` state in iptables rules.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 🤬 **FRUSTRATION** at first! The rules didn't work and I accidentally locked myself out of the server (needed to use the console). Then, 🤩 **VERY HAPPY** when the ping tests finally failed correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> My initial rules were too broad. I should have used more specific port numbers and **interface** names (`eth0` or `enp0s3`) from the start, instead of just general rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Glosary (5+ words):</strong> *iptables*, *Chain (Policy)*, *Stateless*, *Three-way Handshake*, *DROP*, *ACL (Access Control List)*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement Grade (0-10):</strong> 8/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> The task was clear, but it didn't give examples of common mistakes (like blocking the INPUT chain too early).</li>
                <li><strong>How Much I Liked It (0-10):</strong> 9/10. Very practical and important!</li>
                <li><strong>Statement Improvement:</strong> Add a warning: "**ALWAYS test the rules before saving them!**"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>💾 Module: BASES2 (Database Administration)</h2>
    <br>

    <h3>Challenge 1: Stored Procedures and Triggers in MySQL</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> The challenge was to create and test a **Stored Procedure** to insert data and a **Trigger** to automatically update a historical log table whenever a record was deleted from the main table.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Using the `DELIMITER` command in MySQL, which is confusing because it's not a standard SQL command, but necessary for multi-statement procedures.</li>
                <li>Understanding the **`FOR EACH ROW`** clause in Triggers and the use of the `OLD` keyword to access the data being modified or deleted.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 😌 **EASY ENOUGH** after watching a few tutorials. The logic was simple, but the syntax was tricky. The delimiter part took me an hour to figure out.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> My trigger only handled `DELETE`. I should have added another trigger for `UPDATE` operations to make the historical log more complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Glosary (5+ words):</strong> *Stored Procedure*, *Trigger*, *DELIMITER*, *Transaction*, *Schema*, *Foreign Key*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement Grade (0-10):</strong> 9/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> The required functionality was precisely defined, which is great for beginners.</li>
                <li><strong>How Much I Liked It (0-10):</strong> 8/10. Good practice, but less fun than server setup.</li>
                <li><strong>Statement Improvement:</strong> Ask for an **Error Handler** inside the Stored Procedure (like a `BEGIN...END` block) to make it more professional.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🕸️ Module: IAW (Implementing Web Applications)</h2>
    <br>

    <h3>Challenge 1: Basic Responsive Layout with Floats and Tables</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> The task was to create a basic web layout with a header, sidebar, and content area. Since I can only use HTML here, I had to simulate this using **nested `TABLE` tags** and the deprecated `align` attribute (which I know is bad, but it was the only way without CSS).</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The old-school and horrible use of **Table-based Layouts** (using `<table>` for structure, not data). This is the *WRONG* way but was useful to understand *why* CSS was invented.</li>
                <li>Understanding the HTML **Doctype** (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) and why it's the very first line of a page.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 😐 **VERY BORED**. I know how to do this properly with CSS Grid/Flexbox, so forcing myself to use old, bad HTML was tedious and felt like a step backward.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> I should have put more effort into organizing the **accessibility** of the code, even without visual improvements. Using correct heading levels (`<h1>` before `<h2>`) is important.</li>
        <li><strong>Glosary (5+ words):</strong> *DOCTYPE*, *Semantic HTML*, *Deprecation*, *Table Layout*, *Attribute*, *Hyperlink*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement Grade (0-10):</strong> 7/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> It was a bit too open-ended, which made me waste time thinking about how to fake responsiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>How Much I Liked It (0-10):</strong> 5/10. It felt like punishment to avoid CSS.</li>
                <li><strong>Statement Improvement:</strong> Explicitly state: "You are allowed to use **HTML5 structural elements** only if they work without CSS (like `<article>`), but focus on the content."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🐍 Module: PYTHON (Scripting and Automation)</h2>
    <br>

    <h3>Challenge 1: Directory Management Script</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> I had to write a Python script that takes a directory path as input, checks if the path exists, and then organizes all the files inside it into subdirectories based on their **file extension** (e.g., all `.jpg` files go into a `Pictures` folder, `.pdf` into `Documents`).</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The difference between the `os` module (older and simpler) and the **`pathlib`** module (newer and object-oriented) for handling file system paths. I used `pathlib` for a cleaner code.</li>
                <li>Proper **Exception Handling** using `try...except FileNotFoundError` to gracefully manage cases where the input path doesn't exist, preventing the script from crashing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 😁 **VERY HAPPY**. I love the logic puzzle of it. It was challenging to make sure that the script didn't move the script itself or its own folders, but it felt like solving a real-world problem.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> My solution uses a simple dictionary mapping. I should implement a **configuration file** (`.ini` or `.json`) to allow users to easily customize the extensions and target folder names without editing the Python code.</li>
        <li><strong>Glosary (5+ words):</strong> *Pathlib*, *File Extension*, *Exception Handling*, *Automation*, *Interpreter*, *Modularity*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement Grade (0-10):</strong> 10/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> It's a perfect practical exercise that shows the power of scripting for system administration tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>How Much I Liked It (0-10):</strong> 10/10. Best challenge so far.</li>
                <li><strong>Statement Improvement:</strong> None needed, it was excellent!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>🌍 Module: GLOBAL (Integrated Final Project)</h2>
    <br>

    <h3>Challenge 1: Designing the Network and Services Infrastructure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> The task was to design the complete **network architecture** (IP range, VLANs, routing) and the services deployment plan (Web server, DB server, Firewall) for a medium-sized company. This was only the *planning* stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>**VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)** and how to calculate the most efficient IP address ranges for different departments to avoid wasting addresses.</li>
                <li>The principle of **Service Isolation** and why you should never run the Web Server, Database, and Firewall on the *same* physical or virtual machine.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 🧠 **CHALLENGED BUT FOCUSED**. It felt like a real consulting job. The amount of detail was overwhelming, but putting all the pieces from the other modules together was very rewarding.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> My initial design was too focused on a single site. I should have immediately included a **Disaster Recovery Plan** with a simple backup site or cloud-based solution for critical services.</li>
        <li><strong>Glosary (5+ words):</strong> *VLSM*, *VLAN (Virtual LAN)*, *Routing Table*, *DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)*, *Subnetting*, *High Availability (HA)*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement Grade (0-10):</strong> 9/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Excellent, comprehensive, and forced critical thinking across all subjects.</li>
                <li><strong>How Much I Liked It (0-10):</strong> 10/10. This is what ASIR is about!</li>
                <li><strong>Statement Improvement:</strong> Include a mandatory section for **Budget Estimation** (even if fictional) to add a business constraint.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
