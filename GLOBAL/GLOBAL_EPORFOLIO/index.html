    <h3>ATTACK_SIMULATION_RA123</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> We used **Kali Purple** to simulate brute-force attacks. First, we generated custom password dictionaries using **Pydictor** (creating number and letter lists) and merged them with **Dymerge**. Then, we used these dictionaries with **Hydra** to attack a local SSH server and a web login form (DVWA).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dictionary Attack workflow:</strong> Understanding that a brute-force attack is only as good as the wordlist you use. Merging lists is key.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydra Syntax:</strong> Learning the specific flags for Hydra (like `-L` for user list vs `-l` for single user, and the http-post-form syntax) was tricky.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong>  **SUPER COOL 😎**. Watching Hydra crack the password and show the green text was very satisfying. I felt like Mr. Robot, although configuring the SSH server at the beginning was a bit boring.</li>
        
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> My dictionary was too small/simple. In a real scenario, I should use bigger wordlists like *rockyou.txt* or generate more complex permutations with Pydictor.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *Brute Force*, *Wordlist*, *SSH (Secure Shell)*, *HTTP POST*, *Base64*.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 9/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Very practical.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> The instructions were vague.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>COMAN2_LINUX_RA1</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> A massive exercise on managing users, groups, and permissions. We worked with `chmod`, `chown`, and special permissions like **Sticky Bit**, **SUID**, and **SGID** in collaborative folders. We also practiced finding files using `grep` (content), `find` (properties), and `locate` inside a simulated directory structure with logs and scripts.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ACLs (Access Control Lists):</strong> Standard permissions (rwx) are not enough when you need a specific user to read a file but not the rest of the group. `setfacl` saved my life here.</li>
                <li><strong>Sticky Bit vs SGID:</strong> SGID inherits the group (good for shared folders), but Sticky Bit prevents users from deleting each other's files (good for /tmp). Confusing at first!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong>  **OVERWHELMED**. There were so many commands. The `grep` regex part (`^#`) to find lines without comments took me a while to figure out.</li>
        
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> I should memorize the numeric codes for permissions (like 777, 644, 1777) better so I don't have to calculate them manually every time.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *ACL*, *Sticky Bit*, *SGID*, *Recursive Search*, *Regex*, *Umask*.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 10/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> It covers absolutely everything about Linux administration.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Maybe split it into two parts, it was very long for a single session.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>MALWARES_RA123</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> We had to research and present in a team about different malware types: **Cryptojacking**, **Adware**, **Ransomware**, etc. The rule was "no reading from slides". We had to explain the definition, attack techniques, and real cases.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cryptojacking:</strong> How hackers use your CPU to mine cryptocurrency without you knowing. I didn't know this could happen via web scripts (Coinhive).</li>
                <li><strong>Social Engineering in Adware:</strong> How adware isn't just annoying pop-ups but often tricks users into installing worse malware.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 😨 **NERVOUS**. I hate public speaking. But researching the real cases was actually interesting.</li>
        
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> Our slides had too much text. Next time, more images and diagrams, and less bullet points so we are forced not to read.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *Cryptojacking*, *Ransomware*, *Adware*, *Backdoor*, *Social Engineering*.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 7/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Good for soft skills, but I prefer coding.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Allow a recorded video presentation instead of live speaking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>EXPLOIT_BOOM_RA123</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> We developed two vulnerable web apps (one in Python/Flask, one in PHP). We performed **SQL Injection** attacks to bypass login screens using payloads like `' OR 1=1 --`. Then we did **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** attacks. Finally, we fixed the code using "Prepared Statements" and input sanitization (`htmlspecialchars`).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prepared Statements:</strong> Why concatenating strings in SQL is a deadly sin. Parameterized queries separate code from data.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflected vs Persistent XSS:</strong> The difference between a script that executes once (search bar) vs one that stays in the database and hacks everyone who visits the page.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 😈 **POWERFUL**. Bypassing a login without a password felt magical. Fixing the code made me feel like a responsible developer.</li>
        
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> My PHP code for the fix was a bit messy. I should organize the files better instead of putting logic and HTML in the same file.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *SQL Injection*, *XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)*, *Payload*, *Sanitization*, *Prepared Statements*.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 5/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Wasn' in the mood.
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Too complicated.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <h2 align="center">💾 DATABASE ADMINISTRATION</h2>
    <br>

    <h3>DBA_MYSQL_RA12: Server Configuration</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> I acted as a DBA consultant for 3 different companies. I had to configure 15 specific MySQL parameters (like `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `max_connections`, `slow_query_log`) based on interview transcripts. I explained the "why" for each value in a table and modified the configuration files.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Buffer Pool Size:</strong> Calculating the correct RAM allocation (usually 70-80% of dedicated RAM) so the server doesn't crash.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow Query Log:</strong> How to enable logging for queries that take longer than `long_query_time` to execute, which is essential for performance tuning.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 😵 **CONFUSED** at first with so many parameters. I didn't know where the config file was (`/etc/mysql/my.cnf` vs `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/`). But satisfying when the service restarted correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> I would automate the calculation of memory parameters using a script instead of doing it manually with a calculator.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *InnoDB Buffer Pool*, *My.cnf*, *Slow Query Log*, *Bind Address*, *Performance Schema*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 8/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Very realistic scenario (consulting).</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Include more specific RAM limits for the fictional companies to make the math harder.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>USERS_MYSQL_RA23: User Management & "Red Social"</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> We created a "Social Network" database with 3 tables (User, Group, Comment) and FK relationships. Then we managed 3 users (Bego, Mati, Mifli) granting them very specific permissions (SELECT, UPDATE, REVOKE). We also tested access from different domains and changed passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>FLUSH PRIVILEGES:</strong> Why it's necessary when you modify the grant tables directly but not when you use `GRANT/REVOKE` commands.</li>
                <li><strong>GRANT OPTION:</strong> The ability to let a user (like 'Crispula') give permissions to *other* users. It's dangerous if not controlled!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 👮 **LIKE A POLICE OFFICER**. Controlling exactly who can delete data and who can only read was fun. I hated the syntax errors when typing `IDENTIFIED BY`.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> I repeated the same commands many times. I should have created a `.sql` script to run everything at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *DCL (Data Control Language)*, *Grant Option*, *Flush Privileges*, *Foreign Key (FK)*, *Revoke*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 9/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Very complete, covers all CRUD permissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> The part about creating the specific tables was a bit repetitive to type manually.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>DBA_SQLITE_RA12: "Frutitas Bonitas" Optimization</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> We managed a local SQLite database for a fruit app (Mandarinas, Melocotones, Caquis). We had to create tables, analyze storage size, optimize performance using logs and `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`, and set up automated backups.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PRAGMA:</strong> Special commands in SQLite to change how the DB behaves (like `PRAGMA synchronous` or `PRAGMA journal_mode`).</li>
                <li><strong>WAL (Write-Ahead Logging):</strong> A journaling mode that allows simultaneous reading and writing, which is much faster than the default DELETE mode.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 🍊 **AMUSED** by the fruit names, but surprised by how complex SQLite can be. I thought it was just a simple file.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> I didn't fully understand the "explain query plan" output at first. I need to study more about database indexing.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *Pragma*, *WAL (Write-Ahead Log)*, *Explain Query Plan*, *Auto-increment*, *Journaling*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 7/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Good concepts, but SQLite feels less "pro" than MySQL.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Provide a larger dataset (thousands of fruits) to really see the performance difference.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>POSTGRES_DBA_RA34: Equitation DB & Advanced Features</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> We installed PostgreSQL on Linux, created a Horse Riding database ("Equitacion Suave"), and managed Roles using both CLI and **pgAdmin**. We also implemented advanced features like JSON columns, Arrays, and Materialized Views.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JSONB in SQL:</strong> Storing JSON data inside a table column. It allows NoSQL flexibility within a relational database.</li>
                <li><strong>Materialized Views:</strong> Unlike normal views, these store the data physically to make complex queries faster, but you have to refresh them manually.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 🤩 **IMPRESSED**. pgAdmin is a very nice tool, much better than the command line. Using Arrays in a table felt weird coming from MySQL.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> The inheritance part (table inheritance) was confusing. I'm not sure when I would use that in real life instead of a Foreign Key.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *JSONB*, *Materialized View*, *pgAdmin*, *Role*, *Table Inheritance*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 10/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> It covered everything from installation to very advanced topics.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> None, it was excellent.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <br>

    <h3>EXTENSIONES_VSC_IAW_RA1: VS Code & PHP Setup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> I researched the best **VS Code extensions** for PHP development. I had to select the top 3 and discard others, explaining the reasons for each choice. Finally, I created a **Markdown (.md)** document in my Git repository with an index linking to each extension review.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Markdown Anchors:</strong> How to create an internal index (Table of Contents) in a markdown file using `[Link](#anchor)` syntax.</li>
                <li><strong>Linter vs Formatter:</strong> Understanding the difference between a tool that finds errors (Linter) and one that just makes the code look pretty (Formatter).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 😐 **OKAY**. Searching for extensions was easy, but writing the report was a bit repetitive. It's useful to have the environment set up, though.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> I should have tested the "discarded" extensions more thoroughly instead of just relying on their description or star rating.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *Markdown*, *Repository*, *Linter*, *Snippet*, *IntelliSense*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 8/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Good for starting the course with the right tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Make us write a small script using those extensions to prove they work.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>DA2_RA15: Dice Game App</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> I built a web application using **PHP** and HTML to simulate a dice game between two players. It has two pages: a **form** to select the number of dice, faces, and opponent points, and a **results page** that generates random numbers, sums them up, and declares a winner.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Handling Forms (`$_POST`):</strong> Sending data from the input form to the PHP script without showing it in the URL (unlike GET).</li>
                <li><strong>Server-Side Logic:</strong> Using `rand()` inside a loop to generate dynamic HTML content based on user input. It felt like real programming!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 🎲 **ENTERTAINED**. It was fun to see the random numbers appear. Logic errors (like calculating the winner wrong) were annoying but satisfying to fix.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> The app looks very ugly because I only used HTML. I need to add **CSS** to make the dice look like real cubes and not just numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *$_POST*, *rand()*, *Form Action*, *Server-Side Scripting*, *Array*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 9/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Very practical and interactive.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Provide some basic CSS assets so we don't have to look at a plain white page.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <h2 align="center">🐍 PYTHON </h2>
    <br>

    <h3>EXTENSIONES_VSC_PYTHON_RA1: VS Code & Python Setup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> I conducted a study on the best **VS Code extensions** for Python development. I selected the top 3 extensions (likely the core *Python* extension, Pylance, and a formatter like Black) and justified why I kept or discarded several others. The result was a **Markdown (.md)** document with an index in my Git repository.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>**Language Server Protocol (LSP):** Understanding that extensions like Pylance use the LSP to provide powerful features like code completion and error checking without relying only on the Python interpreter.</li>
                <li>**Virtual Environments:** Realizing the importance of selecting the correct Python interpreter (often inside a virtual environment) within VS Code for everything to work correctly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 🤓 **ORGANIZED**. This task forces you to set up your environment correctly from the start. I found Pylance much better than the old language server.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> The process of justifying why I discarded certain extensions felt a bit arbitrary if they were not bad, just less popular.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *Pylance*, *Virtual Environment*, *LSP (Language Server Protocol)*, *Interpreter*, *Formatter*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 8/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Essential step for Python development.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Should integrate with the Git extension study for a complete workflow.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h3>NAVARREDONDA_PYTHON_RA125: Amusement Park Ticket Simulator</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> I developed a Python program to calculate the final price of an amusement park ticket based on 7 input parameters and 12 prioritized modification rules (from free entry for seniors/members to fixed weekend surcharges). The core challenge was implementing the **priority system** correctly, where only the highest priority rule that is met applies.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>**Conditional Logic (`if`/`elif`/`else`):** Mastering the use of `elif` (else if) to ensure that once a high-priority rule is met (e.g., Free Entry, Rule 1), the program stops checking the lower-priority rules (e.g., 50% discount, Rule 2).</li>
                <li>**Random Simulation:** Implementing the automatic input for "Day of the week" and "Is a club member" using the `random` module to test different scenarios.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 🧠 **FOCUSED**. This was a pure logic puzzle. It was tricky handling the floating-point math (decimals) correctly and making sure the output format was exactly as requested.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> The price calculation logic became a huge block of `if/elif`. I could probably refactor it into separate functions to make it cleaner.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *elif*, *Floating Point Arithmetic*, *Random Module*, *Input Validation*, *Prioritized Logic*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 10/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Excellent practice for real-world business logic and complex priority rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> None, it was a solid programming challenge.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <h3>FASTEST_TURTLE_RA12345: Creative Graphics with Turtle</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Summary:</strong> I used the Python **Turtle** graphics library to complete three exercises: 1) Draw the La Salle star, 2) Write my name without using the `write()` function (by drawing letters with lines), and 3) Create a complex, creative drawing using over 30 function calls (many via `for` or `while` loops). </li>
        <li><strong>Complex Concepts Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>**Procedural Graphics:** Understanding how simple commands (`forward`, `left`, `right`) can create complex shapes when combined with iterative loops (`for` loops and modular arithmetic: `i % 90`).</li>
                <li>**State Management:** Using functions like `penup()` and `pendown()` to move the drawing cursor without leaving a trace, which was essential for "writing" the name.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How I Felt:</strong> 🎨 **CREATIVE**. It was a fun break from pure logic. I enjoyed making the complex pattern in Exercise 3 (the one that uses `forward(i%90)`). It was visually stunning.</li>
        <li><strong>What I'd Improve:</strong> The installation process for `tkinter` can sometimes be tricky on different Linux distributions if it's not pre-installed.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossary words:</strong> *Turtle*, *Tkinter*, *Procedural Generation*, *Modular Arithmetic*, *Pen Up/Down*.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Statement Review:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grade:</strong> 9/10.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Great way to learn basic Python structure (loops, functions) in a visual way.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> Include an exercise that requires user interaction (e.g., drawing based on keyboard input).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
